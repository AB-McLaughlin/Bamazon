BAMAZON, a store front

## Overview

This app takes in orders from customers and depletes stock from the store's inventory. 

##How it works

The customer starts the application and gets a welcome greeting as well as a list of the available products.  The customer is prompted to enter an ItemID from the list of products.  Then the customer is prompted to enter the quantity of the product they want.

The customer then sees how much of the product is available.
  If the amount is less than the quantity on hand, the order is processed.  The customer sees a message thanking them for the order.  They are then asked if they need anything else, and the product list shows again.  However they are told they can exit using Ctrl+C if they are finished.

  If the amount is more than the quantity on hand, the customer is told how many are available and is asked to submit the order again.  If they are successful, they receive the thank you message and the offer to order something else or the option to exit.
